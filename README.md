# Digital-Inequality-in-U.S Broadband Access
📘 About the Project
In this project, I analyze the digital inequality across U.S. counties, using socioeconomic indicators to model broadband internet access. The project uses ACS data (American Community Survey), linear regression, and visualization tools in R to explore how factors like income, education, and age influence broadband subscriptions. The goal is to highlight disparities in digital connectivity across different regions of the United States.
